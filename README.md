# Home Machine Upgrade

This machine was brought to me for an Upgrade and Repair. This machine was first made in 2007 and had a major upgrade in 2013 with a new motherboard, processor and ram installed. 

However in 2020 I was asked to Upgrade and Repair this machine as it was making a horrible noise when it was turned on and the power button on the case was broken. The machine was also reported to be quite slow, however the machine was only used for genral office use and web browsing. Therefore the decision to upgrade was perferred to buying a completely new build.

## Loud Noise
I sourced the loud noise to the Power Supply Unit. The PSU rattled loudly when the machine was turned on but stopped rattling after 2- 3 minutes. After reviewing the unit I decided to swap it for a newwer one as this PSU was the original unit from 2007 and I could not be sure of it's reliability even if I decided to fix it.

Below is the original unit that I removed. I replaced it with a Corsair VS450.

## Case Upgrade
I had a spare case from another project I had completed for a friend. When I rebuilt their PC they gave me their old case and as it was still in good condition I kept it. 

The original case had a broke power button that I could not easily fix. This was because the plastic holding the button in place had broken so for now I decided to swap to the spare case completely.

In the image below you can see the damage to the power button. (This is without being turned on).

## GPU Replacement
Part of the sluggish performance of this machine was linked to its GPU. The GPU was the original from 2007 and was worse than the intergated graphics included in the newer processor. Because this graphic card was a hinderance I removed it and replaced it with a newer budget card. The current processer included was not the most powerful so I thought best to replace rather than remove to reduce the strain on the CPU.

Below is the identifying sticker on the previous card, you can match the sticker and see how underpowered this card is for a modern machine.

## Software Update and SSD Swap Over
Next was transferring the HDD to a SSD. The drive was the original drive and was operating quite slowly. I backed up the Hard Drive before transferring it over. However here I found a hinderance. When this machine was last upgraded, the person who did so upgraded it to a 32 Bit Version of Windows 7. This meant I couldn't then upgrade it to a 64 Bit Version of Windows 10 and had to do a fresh install. 

I wanted to change the version to 64 Bit as this machine really should have been running on 64 Bit to begin with and was essentioanlly cutting its potentional resources in half, especially in regards to the RAM which was limited to 4GB in 32 Bit even though there was 8GB installed. 

Therefore I had to start with a fresh install on the SSD and then manually transfer the needed files over. 

## Final Result

While this project required a lot more steps than initally thought, there was a succesful result. The initial obvious problems were resolved and performance was very much improved. This machine now runs silently and much cooler than it was before. The client was very pleased with the work. I am very pleased with the work also and think the PC should last for a long time without much maitenance.

The images below show the completed project.
